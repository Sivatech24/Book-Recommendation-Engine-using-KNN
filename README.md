Book Recommendation Engine using KNN
Import Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries imported. You'll likely need pandas for data manipulation and NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors for building the recommendation model.

Load and Preprocess Data: Load the Book-Crossings dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing users/books with insufficient ratings, and encoding categorical variables.

Build Recommendation Model: Use NearestNeighbors to build a model that computes the nearest neighbors for each book. Fit the model using the processed data.

Create get_recommends Function: Define a function named get_recommends that takes a book title as input and returns a list of 5 similar books along with their distances from the input book.

Test Your Function: Test the get_recommends function with a sample book title to ensure it returns the expected output.
